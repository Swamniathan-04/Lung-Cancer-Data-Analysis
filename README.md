# 🫁 Lung Cancer Data Analysis 📊

Welcome to the **Lung Cancer Data Analysis** project!  
This repository contains interactive notebooks, scripts, and visualizations exploring lung cancer datasets for data-driven insights and impactful discoveries.  
Let’s make data work for better healthcare outcomes! 🚀

---

## ✨ Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
  Gain a deep understanding of lung cancer datasets with interactive plots and descriptive statistics.

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**:  
  Handle missing values, outliers, and categorical encoding for robust machine learning.

- **Visualization Dashboards**:  
  Interactive charts and dashboards using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly.

- **Predictive Modeling**:  
  Build and evaluate classification/regression models for lung cancer risk and outcomes.

- **Model Interpretability**:  
  Feature importance, SHAP values, and explainable AI for trustworthy predictions.

- **Jupyter Notebooks**:  
  Easy-to-follow notebooks for each step of the workflow.
